Informed and Uninformed Search Strategies On  Water Sort Puzzle Problems

# Abstract
Water sort puzzle, also known as ball sort puzzle, is 
a puzzle game which the player tries to sort colored water or balls 
in glasses in a way all the glasses are completely full or empty and 
each glass has the same color. The puzzle has different levels, as 
levels increase the difficulties increase. In this Project, different 
search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence name Uninformed and 
Informed searches are performed on the puzzle, to compare the 
performance of them and find the most optimal one.

# Search Algorithms
There are two types of search algorithms which are used 
based on the search problem: 

• Uninformed search algorithms: They do not have 
additional information about the goal and are 
known as blind search. These algorithms start 
from the initial state and traverses the tree to 
reach goal state. Breadth-first search, Depth First 
Search and Uniform Cost Search are discussed here.

• Informed search algorithms: They have additional 
information about the goal by something called 
heuristic. Greedy Search and A* Tree Search are discussed here.
